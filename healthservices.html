    <h2>Student Health Services Faces Budget Cuts</h2>

    <p>Student health services is facing budget cuts for the coming academic year, laying off one physician assistant and decreasing hours for other in-house providers of medical services, according to Jayne Jordan, director of medical services.</p>
    <p>The department was told to cut their budget by $125,000 for the next academic year, according to Jordan. Staff at student health services were told by administrators that this cut is just one element of an in-depth look at the finances of departments across the university, Jordan said.</p>
    <p>For the first time in at least 15 years, the health services fee will not go up next semester. The $370 fee is paid each semester by every undergraduate student enrolled in six or more credits and by graduate students who wish to have access to the department.</p>
    <p>Student health services brought in $6,475,740 in revenue from student health fees for the 2017-2018 academic year, based on data provided by Amy Malsin, a spokesperson for the university. That year, the budget for student health services, which includes salaries and supplies, came to $3,612,498, according to Malsin. An additional expense of $303,284 came from rent and overhead, according to a report written by student health services.</p>
    <p>In total, health services fees brought in $2,559,958 not directly used by student health services.</p>
    <p>The medical services office at the university is currently staffed by two part-time physicians, two full-time physician assistants, two part-time physician assistants, a full-time midwife providing gynecological care, and one registered nurse.</p>
    <p>In July, one current part-time physician assistant will leave their position and will not be replaced. At the same time, one of the part-time physicians will halve their hours.</p>
    <p>Both medical and counseling services are looking for ways to expand their capacity despite shrinking budgets. Each year, the counseling department has graduate students in clinical psychology from local universities on staff to provide counseling to students, according to Jerry Finkelstein, director of counseling services. As externships for clinical psychology programs, these positions are unpaid and require supervision.</p> 
    <p>The medical department has developed a similar partnership with Long Island University and is in the process of finding physician assistants in training to take supervised shifts in the department.</p>
    <p>“We’re trying to build a staff without costing the university money, because, you know, they’re not necessarily able to give us money at this point,” Finkelstein said.</p>
    <p>The health center has “very motivated folks, but they’re kind of reaching a wall,” said Diana Cusumano, who works with the New School through a partnership with JED Campus, a suicide-prevention program for colleges and universities.</p>
    <p>Cusumano expressed concern that the university may move to outsourcing services, noting white papers written by both the counseling and medical departments that attest to the importance of these services for students. “I think anyone who’s working in higher education right now could see the need for [mental health services],” she said. “I think it’s budgetary. [Administrators] are trying to figure out how to best spread their budget.”</p>
    <p>Annie Holberg, a Parsons fashion design sophomore, uses student health services for counseling and medical. The first time Holberg sought medical services on campus, she visited a nearby clinic but spent hours in the waiting room.</p>
